	The computer is the device that has made tremendous progress in the world of information and data in terms of The speed of their preservation and organization, as well as analysis and reference to any information that was saved as quickly as possible.
One of the biggest benefits of using a computer is to save time where you can get the information in part from the second.
 Cryptography is the science of encrypting and decrypting data. Based on complex mathematics, cryptography provides several important information security services such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Cryptographic protocols and applications make cryptography user-friendly and enable users to secure their data without having to carry out the complex mathematics themselves.
