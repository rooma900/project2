	<h2>Ada Lovelace & Charles Babbage</h2>

	<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
	it's all started when Ada Lovelace the English mathematician met another 
	mathematician called Charles Babbage who had the idea of designing a calculating 
	machine called the difference engine.
	Lovelace admired the idea of the different engine and worked with Babbage 
	on his new idea which is a more advanced machine called the analytical engine
	In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea 
	wrote about the Analytical Engine she added thousands of words to the paper.
	Lovelace believed that the analytical engine will produce a lot of potential
	by carrying out a massive number of mathematical operations.
	The example about what she wrote was how to calculate Bernoulli numbers

		Alan Turing is the founder of modern computer science by inventing 
	"the automatic computing engine" which is the first complete specification 
	of an electronic stored-program all-purpose digital computer.
	if it's built as he planned it would have had vastly more memory than any of the other 
	early computers as well as being faster.
	however the NPL (national physics laboratory) thought the engineering is too difficult
	to be applied and a smaller machine was built, the pilot model ACE in 1950

	<h2>Grace hopper</h2>

	<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
	grace hopper was a Ph.D. in mathematics, who devoted almost her entire life to 
	computers and programming.
	and she has built  the first compiler in 1952 (for Sperry rand computer) known as 
	the a-o system and she said that she invented the compiler because she was lazy 
	and she hoped that the programmer return to be a mathematician.
	she published The Education of a Computer, in which she described 
	fundamental principles in programming and anticipated future developments.</p>

	<h2>The Ada language</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
		
	ada language is a high-level programming language that was originally designed by 
	a team led by French computer scientist Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell Bull under 
	contract to the United States Department of Defense (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 but
	The first appearance was in February 1980.
