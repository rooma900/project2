	<h2>Cryptography concerns</h2>
	<p><big>
		Attackers can bypass cryptography, hack into computers that are responsible 
		for data encryption and decryption, and exploit weak implementations, such 		as the use of default keys. However, cryptography makes it harder for <br>
		attackers to access messages and data protected by encryption algorithms.

		Growing concerns about the processing power of quantum computing to 
		break current cryptography encryption standards led the National Institute of 
	 	Standards and Technology (NIST) to put out a call for papers among the 
	 	mathematical and science community in 2016 for new public key cryptography standards. 
	 	 Unlike today's computer systems, quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) 
	 	 that can represent both 0s and 1s, and therefore perform two calculations at once.
	 	 While a large-scale quantum computer may not be built in the next decade,
	 	 the existing infrastructure requires standardization of publicly known and understood 
	 	  algorithms that offer a secure approach, according to NIST. The deadline for submissions was in November 2017, analysis of the proposals is expected to take three to five years.

	<h3>history of cryptography</h3>
	<p>
		History of cryptography The word "cryptography" is derived from the Greek kryptos, meaning hidden. The origin of cryptography is usually dated from about 2000 B.C., with the Egyptian practice of hieroglyphics. These consisted of complex pictograms, the full meaning of which was only known to an elite few. The first known use of a modern cipher was by Julius Caesar (100 B.C. to 44 B.C.), who did not trust his messengers when communicating with his governors and officers. For this reason, he created a system in which each character in his messages was replaced by a character three positions ahead of it in the Roman alphabet. In recent times, cryptography has turned into a battleground of some of the world's best mathematicians and computer scientists. The ability to securely store and transfer sensitive information has proved a critical factor in success in war and business. Because governments do not wish certain entities in and out of their countries to have access to ways to receive and send hidden information that may be a threat to national interests, cryptography has been subject to various restrictions in many countries, ranging from limitations of the usage and export of software to the public dissemination of mathematical concepts that could be used to develop cryptosystems. However, the internet has allowed the spread of powerful programs and, more importantly, the underlying techniques of cryptography, so that today many of the most advanced cryptosystems and ideas are now in the public domain
